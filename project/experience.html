        <p>These are ideal personas Mitchell made for a project at Prudential Financial. Before Mitchell’s 
        colleagues and Mitchell began journey mapping the future state of the product, they must first use the 
        demographic data to form a “consumer” who would be using this product so they can better empathize 
        with the person using this product.</p>
    <img src="images/journeymap.png" alt="Journey Map">
        <p>This Miro board is from a journey mapping session Mitchell facilitated for Prudential Financial. 
            Here Mitchell and colleagues identified every touchpoint (or the consumers journey through their use of 
            this product). At Prudential, Mitchell and colleagues started with the future state (or ideal state) and 
            worked their way back into the current state to find our misalignments with the current product. 
            Mitchell’s colleagues and Mitchell looked at every step and categorized them by different things that 
            may be occurring with the consumer when interacting with the product.</p>
