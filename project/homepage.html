    <p>My name is Mitchell Friedman, I am a student at Syracuse University majoring in psychology and 
        minoring in marketing. I am most interested in cognitive psychology, and I want to use my psychology 
        and marketing knowledge to continue developing my skills to become a CX expert. 
        During my short time at Syracuse University, I have been promoted to a Lead at Syracuse’s Office of 
        Student Engagement, have received certifications in Google’s Fundamentals of Digital Marketing and 
        Google Ads Search, as well as a certification in HubSpot’s Growth Driven Design. The summer before my 
        senior year of college I interned for Prudential Financial on Customer Experience- Journey Management 
        team where I strengthened my knowledge for CX, became an expert at journey mapping and design 
        sprints, and continued strengthening my presentation skills.
        In my free time I am an avid fan of the arts, I watch movies, television, and am a huge fan of music 
        (currently the Grateful Dead). I also am working on becoming a better chef and reigniting my love for 
        running.
